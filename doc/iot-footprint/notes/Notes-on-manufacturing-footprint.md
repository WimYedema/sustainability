- helping companies to calculate their environmental performance based on reliable, verifiable and comparable information
- It also allows [public administrations, NGOs, business partners, â€¦] to have access to such [environmental performance]

    > Including all these aspects in the decision-making process to avoid so-called "burden shifting" is the great advantage that the application of life cycle thinking brings to the development of policies, products and services in today's globalised context.

- 16 impact categories considered [](https://www.notion.so/f37ae5885ada47caa6bfdd3fc91dd2b7?pvs=21)
- **Classification** implies assigning all input and output flows collected in the inventory to the relevant impact categories.
- **Characterisation** is the process to model environmental mechanisms *linking* the *environmental pressures* represented by inventory data (i.e. inputs of resources or emissions associated with the product life cycle) *to each EF impact category*, and to quantify the impact magnitude.
- **Normalisation** is the calculation of the magnitude of the category
indicator results relatively to a reference system.
- **Weighting** is the process of converting normalised results of the different impact categories by using numerical factors *based on the expressed relative importance of the impact categories considered*.

### Classification

Classification requires assigning the material/ energy inputs and outputs inventoried in the LCI to the relevant EF impact category.

### Characterization

Characterisation refers to the calculation of the magnitude of the contribution of each classified input and output to their respective EF impact categories, and aggregation of the contributions within each category.

**The characterisation factors** [WY: CFs in image above] **are substance- or resource-specific.**

Charecterization factors are defined in this excel sheet: [https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/permalink/EF3_1/EF-LCIAMethod_CF(EF-v3.1).xlsx](https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/permalink/EF3_1/EF-LCIAMethod_CF(EF-v3.1).xlsx)
