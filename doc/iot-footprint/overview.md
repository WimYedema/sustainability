# Environmental footprint for IoT systems

In this study I want to explore how to take environmental footprint into account
when designing IoT solutions.

1. The current paper is [here](paper)
2. [equipment lifecycle](equipment-lifecycle) analyses how the manufacturing and
   use phase of the life-cycle impact the environmental footprint
3. [Some collected notes on edge computing](notes/Notes-on-edge-computing)
3. [Some collected notes on manufacturing footprint](notes/Notes-on-manufacturing-footprint)
4. [Some collected notes on ICT GHG emissions](notes/Notes-on-ICT-GHG-emissions)
