**Why I should read this**: This seems to give a detailed and thorough overview into environmental footprint of IoT.

## Overview

In section 2, they clearly outline the lack of good quality data and, as a
result, the lack of good quality literature. They criticize the approaches that
have been taken as too inaccurate (like using laptop PWB numbers for IoT device
PWBs), and rightly so. They do go on to mention a few references that have
better quality.

In section 3, they propose to identify *functional blocks* from which IOT
devices are comprised, and a *hardware specification level* (HSL) that gives
details on the contents of such a functional block. The HSL identifies
differences in a functional block that will have a small (HSL-0) or larger
(HSL-3) environmental impact. The HSL provides nice categories for device
parameters that have different EF impact.

Too bad this study only take global warming potential into account.

We could perhaps extend the HSL idea to edge computers and data centers
equipment.



## Snippets

**p.2: **Ecoinvent and Idemat databases have been used even though they are often
pointed in the literature as not the best suited for LCA of electronics.
