## Snippets from the Conclusion

We have conducted in this study what we believe to be the most detailed, precise
and methodical analysis of the ICT global GHGE footprint, which includes both
the production and the operational energy of ICT devices, as well as the
operational energy for the supporting ICT infrastructure

We have found that the ICT GHGE contribution relative to worldwide footprint
will roughly double from 1 to 1.6% in 2007 to 3e3.6% by 2020. Assuming a
continued annual relative growth ranging from 5.6 to 6.9%, ICT's relative
contribution would exceed 14% of the 2016-level worldwide GHGE by 2040

```{admonition} Wim
It is questionable whether a continued linear growth from the given numbers is 
realistic, especially as more attention is being given to GHG emissions.
```
The lion share of the emissions were found however to be generated by the ICT
infrastructure with data centers being the largest culprit (45%), followed by
communication networks (24%).

Finally, we pointed out some directions for future work such as [...] research
the impact of novel and emerging digital activities such as the Internet of
Things (IoT) and cryptocurrencies.
