87.5% of GHG emissions are due to manufacturing, with office equipment 77.4% and
data centers 10.1%. ICT usage is significantly less, with 6.8% due to datacenter
usage and 5.7% due to office equipment usage. 

Unfortunately the report does not include emissions due to IoT manufacturing and
use. The focus is mostly on office ICT, and also there they did not take cloud usage into account. **As a result, the value of this report is limited for my research.**

## Snippets

From a broader perspective, the ICT activities account for 8 to 10% of European
electricity consumption and up to 4% of its carbon emissions, depending on the
EU country.

WeNR's objective was to mobilise organisations in 3 European countries where INR
is present (France, Belgium and Switzerland) in order to measure the
environmental footprint of their Information Systems and their Sustainable IT
maturity

```{admonition} Wim
75 organizations participated, representing 1309604 employees and 4951304 pieces 
of equipment. They majority of participants (82%) was from France. 
```

As organisations are migrating massively to the CLOUD, some factors could not be
quantified in the study.

```{admonition} Wim
This is a huge gap in the analysis.

More than 80% of the Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) from manufacturing come from
inventory. The three most polluting equipments are: desktops, monitors and
laptops.

```{admonition} Wim
They report 16.9% from datacenters.
```

Office equipment manufacturing is responsible for 77% of the GHG emissions of
the organisations participating in the study. Overall, nearly 90% of GHG
emissions are due to manufacturing (office equipment and data centers combined).

The "office equipment" are : desktops and laptops, smartphones, monitors,
printers, tablets, televisions television sets, projectors, network equipment
and other office equipment

GHGs from usage are almost equally distributed between office equipment and data
centers.

## Questions

* What kind of organizations participate in this survey?
