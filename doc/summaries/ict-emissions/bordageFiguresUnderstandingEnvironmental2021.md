**Why I should read this**: This seems to give a very good foundation for researching environmental footprint of IOT.

Data traffic is expected to be multiplied by 18.4 between 2018 and 2030, driven
by the IoT and smartphone.

Until page 12 the text mostly explains how hard it is to get accurate IOT LCA
numbers and whether IOT is a benefit for the overall EF or not. 

Our LCA study founds that IoT devices in the EU-28 in 2019 represents about 28
TWh of electric consumption over the year

As the load rate of a data centre is much higher than that of an edge computing
unit, it is not certain that smaller, decentralised, and possibly very numerous,
edge computing units would ultimately be as effective as data centres in
limiting the environmental impact of data processing.
